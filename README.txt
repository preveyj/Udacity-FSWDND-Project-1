Udacity Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Project 1 Readme

Hello!  To run this project, just make sure that udacity_project1.py and 
fresh_tomatoes.py are in the same folder, then run the udacity_project1.py file 
and you should see an HTML file pop up with the list of movies.

All the video posters I found are from IMDB.com.  Each of these movies star
Toshiro Mifune, and are among my all-time favorites.

I've added the release date and movie rating information for each movie as well.
Each movie is 'unrated' in the US, though I believe each would comfortably get
a PG-13 rating.  I've also added a CSS style for the headers for this info,
visually setting the headings apart from the data.  That CSS was added to
fresh_tomatoes.py along with extra Python code to the movie entry template and
create_movie_titles().
